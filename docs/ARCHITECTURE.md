## Data Structures

### Taxonomy Tree
The taxonomy is represented as a nested dictionary structure:

```python
{
    "name": "root",
    "children": {
        "Electronics": {
            "name": "Electronics",
            "children": {
                "Cell Phones & Accessories": {
                    "name": "Cell Phones & Accessories",
                    "children": {
                        "Cell Phones": {
                            "name": "Cell Phones",
                            "children": {
                                "Smartphones": {
                                    "name": "Smartphones",
                                    "children": {},
                                    "is_leaf": true
                                }
                            },
                            "is_leaf": false
                        }
                    },
                    "is_leaf": false
                }
            },
            "is_leaf": false
        }
    }
}
```

### Path Storage
For efficient lookup and processing, the system maintains:
- `all_paths`: A list of all taxonomy paths from the file
- `leaf_markers`: A parallel boolean list indicating which paths are leaf nodes
- `level2_categories`: A list of all level-2 category paths for Stage 1 matching
- `leaf_to_path`: A mapping from leaf node names to their full paths

### Result Structure
Classification results are stored with comprehensive metadata:

```python
{
    "product_info": "Product Name: Description",
    "best_match_index": 0,
    "matches": [
        {
            "category_path": ["Electronics", "Cell Phones", "Smartphones"],
            "full_path": "Electronics > Cell Phones > Smartphones",
            "leaf_category": "Smartphones",
            "is_best_match": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## Leaf Node Identification Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated approach to identify leaf nodes (end categories):

1. **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Processes the taxonomy file sequentially
2. **Next-Line Comparison**: For each path, checks if the next line starts with the current path plus " > "
3. **Leaf Determination**: A node is a leaf if:
   - It's the last line in the file, OR
   - The next non-empty line doesn't start with `current_path + " > "`

This approach correctly handles irregular taxonomy structures and ensures accurate leaf node identification.

## Three-Stage Classification Algorithm

### Stage 1: Leaf Node Matching (gpt-4.1-nano)

**Purpose**: Efficiently identify the top 10 most relevant leaf nodes from all categories in the taxonomy.

**Process**:
1. **Leaf Node Extraction**: Identifies all leaf nodes (end categories) from the taxonomy
2. **Prompt Construction**: Creates an enhanced prompt focusing on core product identification
3. **API Request**: Sends product info + all leaf nodes to gpt-4.1-nano
4. **Response Processing**: Extracts and validates the top 10 leaf node selections

**Enhanced Prompting Strategy**:
```
Given the product: '{product_info}', which TEN of these specific categories are most appropriate?

First, think carefully about what the core product being sold is. Focus on the primary item, not accessories or add-ons.
Ignore extraneous or marketing information and identify the fundamental product category.

Categories: {all_leaf_nodes}

Return ONLY the names of the 10 most appropriate categories in order of relevance, one per line, with no additional text or numbering.
```

**Model Configuration**:
- Model: `gpt-4.1-nano` (cost-effective and efficient)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic results)
- Top_p: 0 (deterministic results)

### Stage 2: Layer Filtering (algorithmic)

**Purpose**: Filter selected leaf nodes to only those from the most popular 1st taxonomy layer.

**Process**:
1. **Path Analysis**: Maps each selected leaf to its full taxonomy path
2. **Layer Extraction**: Extracts the 1st-level category from each path (e.g., "Electronics")
3. **Popularity Counting**: Counts occurrences of each top-level category
4. **Filtering**: Keeps only leaves from the most popular 1st-level category

**Algorithm Details**:
```python
# Count first layer occurrences
first_layer_counts = Counter()
for leaf in selected_leaves:
    full_path = leaf_to_path[leaf]
    first_layer = full_path.split(" > ")[0]
    first_layer_counts[first_layer] += 1

# Find most popular layer
most_popular_layer = first_layer_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

# Filter leaves to most popular layer
filtered_leaves = [
    leaf for leaf in selected_leaves 
    if leaf_to_first_layer.get(leaf) == most_popular_layer
]
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures classification consistency within the same product domain
- Eliminates cross-category confusion
- Reduces final selection complexity
- No API calls required (algorithmic processing)

### Stage 3: Final Selection (gpt-4.1-nano)

**Purpose**: Select the single best match from the filtered leaves within the dominant taxonomy layer.

**Process**:
1. **Candidate Formatting**: Converts filtered leaf names to full taxonomy paths
2. **Structured Prompting**: Uses a multi-step approach for product identification
3. **API Request**: Sends structured prompt to gpt-4.1-nano
4. **Selection Parsing**: Extracts the final selection and converts to 0-based index

**Structured Prompting Strategy**:
```
Given the product: '{product_info}', which ONE of these categories is most appropriate?

First, explicitly identify what specific product is being sold here:
1. What is the actual core product? (not accessories or related items)
2. Is this a main product or an accessory FOR another product?
3. Distinguish between the product itself and any packaging, cases, or add-ons mentioned.

Keep your determination of the core product firmly in mind when making your selection.
Be especially careful to distinguish between categories for the main product versus categories for accessories.

Categories:
1. Electronics > Cell Phones > Smartphones
2. Electronics > Cell Phone Accessories > Cases
...

First identify the core product in a sentence, then select the number of the most appropriate category.
Return ONLY the NUMBER of the most appropriate category, with no additional text.
```

**Model Configuration**:
- Model: `gpt-4.1-nano` (consistent across all stages)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic results)
- Top_p: 0 (deterministic results)
