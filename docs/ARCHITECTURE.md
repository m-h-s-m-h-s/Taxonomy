## Data Structures

### Taxonomy Tree
The taxonomy is represented as a nested dictionary structure:

```python
{
    "name": "root",
    "children": {
        "Electronics": {
            "name": "Electronics",
            "children": {
                "Cell Phones & Accessories": {
                    "name": "Cell Phones & Accessories",
                    "children": {
                        "Cell Phones": {
                            "name": "Cell Phones",
                            "children": {
                                "Smartphones": {
                                    "name": "Smartphones",
                                    "children": {},
                                    "is_leaf": true
                                }
                            },
                            "is_leaf": false
                        }
                    },
                    "is_leaf": false
                }
            },
            "is_leaf": false
        }
    }
}
```

### Path Storage
For efficient lookup and processing, the system maintains:
- `all_paths`: A list of all taxonomy paths from the file
- `leaf_markers`: A parallel boolean list indicating which paths are leaf nodes
- `leaf_to_path`: A mapping from leaf node names to their full paths

### Result Structure
Classification results are stored with comprehensive metadata:

```python
{
    "product_info": "Product Name: Description",
    "best_match_index": 0,
    "matches": [
        {
            "category_path": ["Electronics", "Cell Phones", "Smartphones"],
            "full_path": "Electronics > Cell Phones > Smartphones",
            "leaf_category": "Smartphones",
            "is_best_match": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## Leaf Node Identification Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated approach to identify leaf nodes (end categories):

1. **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Processes the taxonomy file sequentially
2. **Next-Line Comparison**: For each path, checks if the next line starts with the current path plus " > "
3. **Leaf Determination**: A node is a leaf if:
   - It's the last line in the file, OR
   - The next non-empty line doesn't start with `current_path + " > "`

This approach correctly handles irregular taxonomy structures and ensures accurate leaf node identification.

## Five-Stage Classification Algorithm

### Stage 1: Initial Leaf Node Matching (gpt-4.1-nano)

**Purpose**: Efficiently identify the top 20 most relevant leaf nodes from all categories in the taxonomy.

**Process**:
1. **Leaf Node Extraction**: Identifies all leaf nodes (end categories) from the taxonomy
2. **Prompt Construction**: Creates an enhanced prompt focusing on core product identification
3. **API Request**: Sends product info + all leaf nodes to gpt-4.1-nano
4. **Response Processing**: Extracts and validates the top 20 leaf node selections

**Enhanced Prompting Strategy**:
```
Given the product: '{product_info}', which TWENTY of these specific categories are most appropriate?

First, think carefully about what the core product being sold is. Focus on the primary item, not accessories or add-ons.
Ignore extraneous or marketing information and identify the fundamental product category.

Categories: {all_leaf_nodes}

Return ONLY the names of the 20 most appropriate categories in order of relevance, one per line, with no additional text or numbering.
```

**Model Configuration**:
- Model: `gpt-4.1-nano` (cost-effective and efficient)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic results)
- Top_p: 0 (deterministic results)

### Stage 2: Layer Filtering (algorithmic)

**Purpose**: Filter selected leaf nodes to only those from the most popular 1st taxonomy layer.

**Process**:
1. **Path Analysis**: Maps each selected leaf to its full taxonomy path
2. **Layer Extraction**: Extracts the 1st-level category from each path (e.g., "Electronics")
3. **Popularity Counting**: Counts occurrences of each top-level category
4. **Filtering**: Keeps only leaves from the most popular 1st-level category

**Algorithm Details**:
```python
# Count first layer occurrences
first_layer_counts = Counter()
for leaf in selected_leaves:
    full_path = leaf_to_path[leaf]
    first_layer = full_path.split(" > ")[0]
    first_layer_counts[first_layer] += 1

# Find most popular layer
most_popular_layer = first_layer_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

# Filter leaves to most popular layer
filtered_leaves = [
    leaf for leaf in selected_leaves 
    if leaf_to_first_layer.get(leaf) == most_popular_layer
]
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures classification consistency within the same product domain
- Eliminates cross-category confusion
- Reduces complexity for subsequent stages
- No API calls required (algorithmic processing)

### Stage 3: Refined Selection (gpt-4.1-nano)

**Purpose**: Refine selection to the top 10 most relevant leaf nodes from filtered L1 taxonomy candidates.

**Process**:
1. **Candidate Analysis**: Takes filtered leaves from Stage 2 (all from same L1 taxonomy layer)
2. **Refined Prompting**: Uses AI to select top 10 most relevant categories from filtered candidates
3. **API Request**: Sends structured prompt to gpt-4.1-nano
4. **Selection Processing**: Extracts and validates the refined selection

**Refined Prompting Strategy**:
```
Given the product: '{product_info}', which TEN of these specific categories are most appropriate?

These categories have already been filtered to the most relevant taxonomy layer. 
Your task is to select the 10 most precise matches from this refined list.

Categories: {filtered_leaves}

Return EXACTLY 10 category names from the above list, one per line, with no additional text.
```

**Model Configuration**:
- Model: `gpt-4.1-nano` (consistent with Stage 1)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic results)
- Top_p: 0 (deterministic results)

**Key Insight**: This is essentially Stage 1 repeated, but with a smaller, more focused set of leaf nodes from the same L1 taxonomy layer.

### Stage 4: Validation (algorithmic)

**Purpose**: Ensure AI didn't hallucinate any category names that don't exist in the taxonomy.

**Process**:
1. **Category Validation**: Checks each refined category name against the actual taxonomy
2. **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies any invalid or non-existent category names
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removes any hallucinated categories from the list
4. **Statistics Logging**: Logs validation results (valid vs invalid categories)

**Algorithm Details**:
```python
# Create mapping from leaf names to full paths for validation
leaf_to_path = self._create_leaf_to_path_mapping()

# Validate each category name exists in the actual taxonomy
validated_categories = []
invalid_categories = []

for category in refined_leaves:
    if category in leaf_to_path:
        validated_categories.append(category)
    else:
        invalid_categories.append(category)
        logger.warning(f"AI returned invalid/hallucinated category: {category}")
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures data integrity before final selection
- Prevents downstream errors from invalid category names
- Provides visibility into AI hallucination patterns
- No API calls required (algorithmic processing)

### Stage 5: Final Selection (gpt-4.1-mini)

**Purpose**: Select the single best match from the validated leaves using enhanced model precision.

**Process**:
1. **Candidate Formatting**: Converts validated leaf names to numbered options
2. **Hardcore Prompting**: Uses explicit constraints and strict formatting requirements
3. **API Request**: Sends structured prompt to gpt-4.1-mini
4. **Selection Parsing**: Extracts the final selection and converts to 0-based index
5. **Anti-Hallucination Validation**: Robust index validation and bounds checking
6. **Multiple Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of invalid AI responses
7. **Final Safety Checks**: Guarantees valid category selection

**Enhanced Prompting Strategy**:
```
CRITICAL TASK: You MUST select the EXACT BEST MATCH from the provided options below.

MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST select ONE of the numbered options below - NO EXCEPTIONS
2. You CANNOT create, modify, or suggest any other category
3. You CANNOT select a category that is not in the list below
4. You MUST return ONLY the number (1, 2, 3, etc.) - nothing else

ANALYSIS STEPS:
Step 1: What is the PRIMARY PRODUCT being sold? (ignore accessories, cases, etc.)
Step 2: Which of the options below EXACTLY matches that primary product?
Step 3: Return the NUMBER of that exact match

AVAILABLE OPTIONS (you MUST choose from these ONLY):
1. Category Option 1
2. Category Option 2
...

ANSWER (number only):
```

**Model Configuration**:
- Model: `gpt-4.1-mini` (enhanced precision for final decision)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic results)
- Top_p: 0 (deterministic results)
