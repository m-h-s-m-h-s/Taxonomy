Taxonomy Navigator - AI-Powered Product Categorization System

This module implements a sophisticated AI classification system that automatically 
categorizes products into appropriate taxonomy categories using OpenAI's GPT models.

=== OPTIMIZED CLASSIFICATION PROCESS ===

The system uses a progressive filtering approach to efficiently narrow down from
thousands of categories to a single best match:

üéØ STAGE 1: L1 TAXONOMY SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Identify the 2 most relevant top-level taxonomy categories
   - Input: Full product description + ALL unique L1 taxonomy categories
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano
   - Process: AI selects 2 most relevant L1 categories (e.g., "Electronics", "Apparel & Accessories")
   - Output: List of 2 L1 category names
   - Key Feature: Focuses on broad category domains for accurate classification
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned category exists

üîç STAGE 2A: FIRST L1 LEAF SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Select the first 15 best leaf nodes from the FIRST chosen L1 taxonomy
   - Input: Full product description + ALL leaf nodes from the FIRST selected L1 category
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano
   - Process: AI selects top 15 most relevant leaf categories from the FIRST L1 taxonomy
   - Output: List of up to 15 leaf node names from the FIRST L1 taxonomy
   - Key Feature: Focuses exclusively on the first L1 taxonomy for better granularity
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned leaf exists

üîç STAGE 2B: SECOND L1 LEAF SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Select the second 15 best leaf nodes from the SECOND chosen L1 taxonomy
   - Input: Full product description + ALL leaf nodes from the SECOND selected L1 category
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano
   - Process: AI selects top 15 most relevant leaf categories from the SECOND L1 taxonomy
   - Output: List of up to 15 leaf node names from the SECOND L1 taxonomy
   - Key Feature: Focuses exclusively on the second L1 taxonomy for better granularity
   - Condition: SKIPPED if only 1 L1 category selected in Stage 1
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned leaf exists

üèÜ STAGE 3: FINAL SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Make the final decision from the combined leaf nodes from Stages 2A and 2B
   - Input: Full product description + up to 30 leaf nodes from combined Stage 2 results
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-mini
   - Process: 
     * Construct clear, professional prompt with specific constraints
     * Present up to 30 categories as numbered options (leaf names only)
     * AI identifies core product and selects best match
     * Parse AI response with robust validation and bounds checking
     * Return guaranteed valid index of selected category OR -1 for complete failure
   - Output: Index of selected category (0-based, guaranteed valid) OR -1 for complete failure
   - Key Feature: Enhanced model for critical final decision
   - Condition: SKIPPED if only 1 leaf selected in Stage 2
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + numeric validation + bounds checking + "False" for failures

=== SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS ===

‚úÖ Efficiency: Progressive filtering (thousands ‚Üí 2 L1s ‚Üí 30 leaves ‚Üí 1)
‚úÖ Cost Optimization: 2-4 API calls per classification (adaptive)
‚úÖ Improved Focus: Each stage focuses on appropriate level of granularity
‚úÖ Accuracy: Each L1 taxonomy is explored independently for better coverage
‚úÖ Scalability: Handles large taxonomies without overwhelming the AI
‚úÖ Model Strategy: Uses gpt-4.1-nano for stages 1-2, gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3
‚úÖ Manageable Chunks: Stage 2 broken into 2 parts of 15 items each for better AI performance

=== KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES ===

- Deterministic Results: Uses temperature=0 and top_p=0 for consistent classifications
- Enhanced Product Identification: Advanced prompting to distinguish products from accessories
- Comprehensive Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- Duplicate Removal: Multiple stages of deduplication for clean results
- L1 Deduplication: Ensures no duplicate L1 categories are sent to AI
- Mixed Model Strategy: gpt-4.1-nano for stages 1 and 2, gpt-4.1 for stage 3
- Death Penalty Prompting: Aggressive anti-hallucination prompts threatening "death" for wrong answers
- Zero Context API Calls: Each API call is a blank slate with no conversation history
- Anti-Hallucination Measures: Robust validation and bounds checking in all AI stages
- Unknown L1 Filtering: Stage 2 removes categories with "Unknown" L1 taxonomy
- Multiple Fallback Mechanisms: Graceful handling of invalid AI responses
- Complete Failure Handling: Returns "False" when AI completely fails or returns nothing

=== ENHANCED ANTI-HALLUCINATION MEASURES ===

üéØ SIMPLIFIED PROMPTING SYSTEM:
- All stages use clean, basic prompts with essential instructions only
- Removed complex anti-hallucination language for better AI performance
- Simple system messages focusing on core task requirements
- Clear, straightforward output format specifications

üîí STRICT VALIDATION AT EVERY STAGE:
- Stage 1: Every returned L1 category is validated against the actual L1 list
- Stage 2A/2B/2C: Every returned leaf category is validated against the filtered leaf list  
- Stage 3: AI response is validated to be numeric and within valid range
- All hallucinations are logged as CRITICAL errors with full context

‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE BOUNDS CHECKING:
- Stage 3 validates AI returns only numbers between 1 and max options
- All indices are bounds-checked before array access
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for invalid responses
- Returns -1 (False) for any validation failure

üõ°Ô∏è MULTIPLE VALIDATION LAYERS:
- Regex validation for numeric responses in Stage 3
- Exact string matching for category validation in Stages 1 & 2
- Duplicate detection and removal at every stage
- Comprehensive logging of all validation steps

    AI-powered taxonomy navigation system for product categorization.
    
    This class implements a five-stage classification approach:
    1. L1 taxonomy selection to identify the 3 most relevant top-level categories
    2. Stage 2A: First 10 leaf node selection from the chosen L1 taxonomies
    3. Stage 2B: Second 10 leaf node selection (excluding 2A results)
    4. Stage 2C: Third 10 leaf node selection (excluding 2A and 2B results)
    5. Final selection from the combined 30 leaf nodes from Stages 2A, 2B, 2C
    
    The system is designed to handle large taxonomies efficiently while maintaining
    high accuracy in distinguishing between products and their accessories.
    
    Key Improvements in v8.0:
    - Redesigned to use a five-stage process with Stage 2 broken into manageable chunks
    - Updated to use gpt-4.1-nano for all stages for consistency
    - Enhanced error handling throughout the five-stage pipeline
