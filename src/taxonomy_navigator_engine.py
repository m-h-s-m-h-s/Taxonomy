Taxonomy Navigator - AI-Powered Product Categorization System

This module implements a sophisticated three-stage AI classification system that automatically 
categorizes products into appropriate taxonomy categories using OpenAI's GPT models.

=== FIVE-STAGE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS ===

The system uses a progressive filtering approach that efficiently narrows down from thousands 
of categories to a single best match:

üéØ STAGE 1: L1 TAXONOMY SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Identify the 3 most relevant top-level taxonomy categories
   - Input: Product info + ALL unique L1 taxonomy categories (no duplicates)
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano (unified model for all stages)
   - Process: AI selects 3 most relevant L1 categories (e.g., "Electronics", "Hardware", "Apparel")
   - Output: List of 3 L1 category names
   - Key Feature: Focuses on broad category domains first for better accuracy
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned category exists

üîç STAGE 2A: FIRST L1 LEAF SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Select the first 10 best leaf nodes from the FIRST chosen L1 taxonomy
   - Input: Product info + ALL leaf nodes from the FIRST selected L1 category
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano (unified model for all stages)
   - Process: AI selects top 10 most relevant leaf categories from the FIRST L1 taxonomy
   - Output: List of up to 10 leaf node names from the FIRST L1 taxonomy
   - Key Feature: Focuses exclusively on the first L1 taxonomy for better granularity
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned leaf exists

üîç STAGE 2B: SECOND L1 LEAF SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Select the second 10 best leaf nodes from the SECOND chosen L1 taxonomy
   - Input: Product info + ALL leaf nodes from the SECOND selected L1 category
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano (unified model for all stages)
   - Process: AI selects top 10 most relevant leaf categories from the SECOND L1 taxonomy
   - Output: List of up to 10 leaf node names from the SECOND L1 taxonomy
   - Key Feature: Focuses exclusively on the second L1 taxonomy for better granularity
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned leaf exists

üîç STAGE 2C: THIRD L1 LEAF SELECTION (AI-Powered)
   - Purpose: Select the third 10 best leaf nodes from the THIRD chosen L1 taxonomy
   - Input: Product info + ALL leaf nodes from the THIRD selected L1 category
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-nano (unified model for all stages)
   - Process: AI selects top 10 most relevant leaf categories from the THIRD L1 taxonomy
   - Output: List of up to 10 leaf node names from the THIRD L1 taxonomy
   - Key Feature: Focuses exclusively on the third L1 taxonomy for better granularity
   - Anti-Hallucination: Professional prompting + strict validation that every returned leaf exists

üèÜ STAGE 3: FINAL SELECTION (AI-Powered with Anti-Hallucination)
   - Purpose: Make the final decision from the combined 30 leaf nodes from Stages 2A, 2B, 2C
   - Input: Product info + up to 30 leaf nodes from combined Stage 2 results
   - AI Model: gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3
   - Process: 
     * Construct clear, professional prompt with specific constraints
     * Present up to 30 categories as numbered options (leaf names only)
     * AI identifies core product and selects best match
     * Parse AI response with robust validation and bounds checking
     * Return guaranteed valid index of selected category OR -1 for complete failure
   - Output: Index of selected category (0-based, guaranteed valid) OR -1 for complete failure
   - Key Features: Professional prompting + numeric validation + bounds checking + "False" for failures

=== SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS ===

‚úÖ Efficiency: Progressive filtering (L1s ‚Üí 3 L1s ‚Üí 10 leaves per L1 ‚Üí 30 leaves ‚Üí 1)
‚úÖ Cost Optimization: Only 5 API calls per classification (Stages 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3)
‚úÖ Improved Focus: Each stage focuses on appropriate level of granularity
‚úÖ Accuracy: Each L1 taxonomy is explored independently for better coverage
‚úÖ Scalability: Handles large taxonomies without overwhelming the AI
‚úÖ Model Strategy: Uses gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3 for consistency
‚úÖ Manageable Chunks: Stage 2 broken into 3 parts of 10 items each for better AI performance

=== KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES ===

- Deterministic Results: Uses temperature=0 and top_p=0 for consistent classifications
- Enhanced Product Identification: Advanced prompting to distinguish products from accessories
- Comprehensive Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- Duplicate Removal: Multiple stages of deduplication for clean results
- L1 Deduplication: Ensures no duplicate L1 categories are sent to AI
- Mixed Model Strategy: gpt-4.1-mini for stage 1, gpt-4.1-nano for stage 2, gpt-4.1-mini for stage 3
- Death Penalty Prompting: Aggressive anti-hallucination prompts threatening "death" for wrong answers
- Zero Context API Calls: Each API call is a blank slate with no conversation history
- Anti-Hallucination Measures: Robust validation and bounds checking in all AI stages
- Unknown L1 Filtering: Stage 2 removes categories with "Unknown" L1 taxonomy
- Multiple Fallback Mechanisms: Graceful handling of invalid AI responses
- Complete Failure Handling: Returns "False" when AI completely fails or returns nothing

=== ENHANCED ANTI-HALLUCINATION MEASURES ===

üéØ SIMPLIFIED PROMPTING SYSTEM:
- All stages use clean, basic prompts with essential instructions only
- Removed complex anti-hallucination language for better AI performance
- Simple system messages focusing on core task requirements
- Clear, straightforward output format specifications

üîí STRICT VALIDATION AT EVERY STAGE:
- Stage 1: Every returned L1 category is validated against the actual L1 list
- Stage 2A/2B/2C: Every returned leaf category is validated against the filtered leaf list  
- Stage 3: AI response is validated to be numeric and within valid range
- All hallucinations are logged as CRITICAL errors with full context

‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE BOUNDS CHECKING:
- Stage 3 validates AI returns only numbers between 1 and max options
- All indices are bounds-checked before array access
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for invalid responses
- Returns -1 (False) for any validation failure

üõ°Ô∏è MULTIPLE VALIDATION LAYERS:
- Regex validation for numeric responses in Stage 3
- Exact string matching for category validation in Stages 1 & 2
- Duplicate detection and removal at every stage
- Comprehensive logging of all validation steps

        2. Stage 2A: Select the first 10 best leaf nodes from the chosen L1 taxonomies
        3. Stage 2B: Select the second 10 best leaf nodes (excluding 2A results)

        The method ensures end-to-end consistency by validating that the final result

        Process Flow:
        1. Stage 1: AI identifies relevant L1 taxonomies from all categories
